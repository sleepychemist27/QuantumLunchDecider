# QuantumLunchDecider
Infalliable randomness to help you decide what to eat for lunch!
Just a small project I made to help me choose what to eat for lunch. Randomness is guaranteed as the random number generated by an API request to the ANU quantum and optics laboratory (live measurement of quantum vaccum fluctuations). https://qrng.anu.edu.au/contact/api-documentation/
